- It can occur that the landlord urgently needs the rented space for personal use. When the landlord cannot prove that there is enough additional living space at hand, then the landlord is obliged to offer the tenant a suitable substitute living space.
- The landlord has given a reasonable proposal for a new rental agreement. When the tenant does not accept the offer, then the landlord is allowed to end the agreement.
- Because of a valid development plan it is necessary that the rented living space becomes vacant again.
- In case a landlord has his or her main property in the same building where he or she rents out rooms, then the so-called “substantial interests of the landlord of rooms” can be a valid reason to end the rental agreement."

What is anti-squatting renting,"A form of very cheap, basic accommodation, anti-squatting networks divide empty buildings into rooms and rent them out at a low rate. Tenants have fewer rights, tenancies are typically short and end suddenly when the building is sold. Facilities are usually basic, but rooms can be large and quiet and rents can be as low as EUR 150 per month."<br> <a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005290/2018-09-19#Boek7_Titeldeel4_Afdeling5_ParagraafOnderafdeling1\">Burgerlijk Wetboek Boek 7</a>
