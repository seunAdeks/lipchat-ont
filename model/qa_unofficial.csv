You can only speak of a campus contract when the contract explicitly states that the living space will be rented out again to another student after termination of the contract.

Can i appeal a verdict from a regular judge,"Do you disagree, as a tenant, with the final verdict of the judge? Then you can also file an appeal. Also in this case, the rental agreement will last until a verdict is given.
When filing an appeal after the verdict from a regular judge, make sure to do this in time. If you wait too long and exceed the deadline for filing an appeal, the given verdict becomes irreversible.

The landlord must inform the tenant about the proposed rent increase in writing, at least two months before the new rent starts.
In the written announcement, the rent increase as well as the current and the new rent should be mentioned. It should also state the exact rate increase.
The date on which the new rent starts should be clearly stated.
As a tenant you should always be given the opportunity to object to the proposed rent increase. Therefor, the letter should always clearly state within which amount of time you, as a tenant, are allowed to object."
When can a landlord end the rental agreement,"In some cases, a landlord can decide to cancel the rental agreement. The terms on which a landlord can do this are written down in the rental law:

- It concerns a temporary rental agreement. In that case, the landlord can officially end the contract to prevent that the rental agreement is being silently continued.
- It can occur that the landlord urgently needs the rented space for personal use. When the landlord cannot prove that there is enough additional living space at hand, then the landlord is obliged to offer the tenant a suitable substitute living space.
- The landlord has given a reasonable proposal for a new rental agreement. When the tenant does not accept the offer, then the landlord is allowed to end the agreement.
- Because of a valid development plan it is necessary that the rented living space becomes vacant again.

If you do this within six months after you signed your contract, you can reclaim the overpaid amount of rent from the moment you initiated the procedure."
Is the landlord allowed to ask for a deposit,"From a juridical standpoint, there are no objections concerning the request of a deposit. If the rented accommodation is in a good state when you leave as a tenant, you will receive back the paid deposit. If the rented accommodation is not in the state that was originally agreed upon,, or when rent has not been paid, then the landlord can compensate the damage with the paid deposit."
How high can the doposit be,"Normally speaking, the amount of deposit equals one month of rent. In case you are paying a lower rent, it might occur that the landlord asks for two months of deposit. In general, deposits of more than two months are not considered reasonable."
The landlord will not give me back my deposit,"At the time of departure, your landlord will inspect the rented accommodation. In case damages or other defects are detected, the landlord can hold the tenant responsible and compensate the suffered damages with the paid deposit. When you disagree as a tenant, you can start a procedure in order to still get the full amount of deposit refunded. In this case, the landlord has to prove that something is actually wrong about the rented space that you as a tenant can be held accountable for. In other words, the burden of proof lies with the landlord."

As a result, you are no longer able to provide the living comfort that you agreed on with your subtenant. When the contract between you and your subtenant comes to an end, the subtenant does not automatically have the right to stay in the sublet."
How should i communicate issues with my landlord,"No matter the cause of the issue, try to make the situation “work” for as long as possible, in other words: don’t make it more severe. Stay correct and professional (concentrate on the facts, and don’t let your emotions guide you) during all contact with your landlord. This way, you prevent yourself of being accused of acting incorrectly or inappropriately later on."
Can i paint or modify my apartment,"You can ask your landlord about these modifications, but ultimately it is the owner who has the final say."
Is a verbal agreement binding,"According to Dutch law, if you make a verbal agreement, even without signing a physical agreement, it is still binding! Beware of this when thinking about your options, and remember that when you come to an agreement with someone, by law, it is as if you signed a contract."
Can i terminate a contract before the minimal rent time has passed,"Even if you are staying for six months, do not hesitate to sign a one-year contract. You can terminate it anytime you wish (provided you honour the notice period)."
Should i sign a pre-contract,"If an agent asks you to sign a pre-contract agreement (usually in Dutch) in order to hold a place in the queue, be sure that you really want to rent the house, otherwise you may be asked later to pay compensation, even if you are not interested anymore. The same applies to verbal contracts / deals, which are binding under Dutch law."
The apartment has pre-existing damages,"Inspect the property before signing the contract to be able to notify the landlord about pre-existing damages (e.g. heating system, radiator etc.)."
What is anti-squatting renting,"A form of very cheap, basic accommodation, anti-squatting networks divide empty buildings into rooms and rent them out at a low rate.
